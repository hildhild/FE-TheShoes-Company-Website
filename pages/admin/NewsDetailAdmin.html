            <strong class="md:text-[25px] text-[20px]">Wales Bonner's adidas Originals Fall/Winter 2023 Collection Debuts On November 8th</strong><br><br>
            <p class="text-[12px]">06/11/2023</p><br>
            <p>Wales Bonner isn't solely responsible for the revival of the adidas Samba, but the menswear brand has played an immense role in the sneaker's return to the mainstream. Unveiled on the runway back in April, the Fall/Winter 2023 collection by Grace Wales Bonner and adidas Originals launches on Wednesday, November 8th.</p><br>
            <p>As with Bonner's other work, her partnership with the Three Stripes continues to explore Afro-Atlantic legacy through sportswear. Off-pitch styles - elevated knitwear, football shorts - are accompanied by four makeovers of the Samba, adidas' oldest footwear design still in production.</p><br>
            <p>Two of the three Wales Bonner Sambas enjoy luxe, but faux pony hair uppers, marrying sportswear heritage with high fashion sensibilities. Gum soles also land on the pairs, complimenting the leopard print, light tan, and black makeovers found up-top. By contrast, a fourth adidas Originals style by the British designer opts for a mahogany brown hue that also appears throughout the Fall/Winter 2023 collection's apparel. Unlike the Samba OG, which has taken over social media feeds and city streets over the last three years, Bonner's styles feature the long, folded tongue that harkens back to the shoe's football origins.</p><br>
            <p>Enjoy detailed photos of the latest from the compelling partnership ahead. The Wales Bonner x adidas collection will be available globally on November 8th adidas.com and the adidas CONFIRMED app. Select retailers across the world will also offer the range of offerings on Wednesday. Each pair ranges from $180 USD to $220 USD.</p><br>
